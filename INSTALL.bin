Install instructions for diffxml and patchxml
=============================================

Requirements:
-------------

Java >= 1.5. See http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html

The lib directory should contain the following jar:

   xpp3-1.1.3.4.C.jar

See the XPP3 webiste for more details: http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xgws/xsoap/xpp/mxp1/index.html. 

Running diffxml:
----------------

The easiest way of running the utilities is to use the diffxml.sh and 
patchxml.sh scripts. 

First edit the files so that $DIFFXML_HOME points to the directory where
diffxml was installed. 
Next, verify the scripts work by running:
 
   $ diffxml.sh test1.xml test2.xml > out.xml
   $ patchxml.sh test1.xml out.xml > result
   $ diffxml.sh -q result test2.xml
 
There should be no output, confirming the files are equivalent.
 
You can then rename the scripts and add them to a public dir e.g:
 
   $ cp diffxml.sh /usr/local/bin/diffxml
   $ cp patchxml.sh /usr/local/bin/patchxml
 
Finally...
----------

Please note that this is an unstable alpha release.
diffxml and patchxml are released under the GNU GPL Version 2.
