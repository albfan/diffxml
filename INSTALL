Install instructions for diffxml and patchxml
---------------------------------------------

If you are reading this file, you should have downloaded and unzipped the source code
for diffxml.

The lib directory contains the following third party jars needed by diffxml:

From Apache Xerces and Xalan:
 
xalan.jar
xercesImpl.jar
xml-apis.jar
xmlParserAPIs.jar
xsltc.jar
 
From XPP3:
 
xpp3_1_0_8a.jar

You should add these jars and the directory this was installed to on your classpath.
You should then be able to build by compiling diffxml.java.

The easiest way of running the utilities is to edit the diffxml.sh and patch.sh 
scripts so that $INSTALL_DIR points to the directory where diffxml was installed,
and $JAR_DIR points to a directory holding the required jar files.

Verify the scripts work by running:
 
diffxml.sh test1.xml test2.xml > out.xml
patchxml.sh test1.xml out.xml > result
diffxml.sh -q result test2.xml
 
There should be no output, confirming the files are equivalent.
 
You can then rename the scripts and add them to a public dir e.g:
 
cp diffxml.sh /usr/local/bin/diffxml
cp patchxml.sh /usr/local/bin/patchxml
 
Please note that this is an unstable alpha release.
diffxml and patchxml are released under the GNU GPL Version 2.

Good Luck.
