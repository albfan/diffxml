Install instructions for diffxml and patchxml
=============================================

If you are reading this file, you should have downloaded and unzipped the 
source code for diffxml.

Requirements:
-------------

Java >= 1.4 (for logging). 
Ant >= 1.5.4 (untested with older versions).

The lib directory should contain the following jars:

   dom3-xercesImpl.jar
   dom3-xml-apis.jar
   xpp3_1_0_8a.jar

These files relate to Apache Xerces ( http://xml.apache.org/ ) and XPP3 
( http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xgws/xsoap/xpp/mxp1/index.html ). 

Building diffxml:
-----------------

To just compile the classes run:

   $ant

To build a jar file run:

   $ant jarDiffXML

Testing diffxml:
----------------

To do a small test to ensure correct compilation run:

   $ ant quickTest

For a fuller test:

   $ ant fullTest


Running diffxml:
----------------

The easiest way of running the utilities is to use the diffxml.sh and 
patchxml.sh scripts. 

First edit the files so that $DIFFXML_HOME points to the directory where
diffxml was installed. 
Next, verify the scripts work by running:
 
   $ diffxml.sh test1.xml test2.xml > out.xml
   $ patchxml.sh test1.xml out.xml > result
   $ diffxml.sh -q result test2.xml
 
There should be no output, confirming the files are equivalent.
 
You can then rename the scripts and add them to a public dir e.g:
 
   $ cp diffxml.sh /usr/local/bin/diffxml
   $ cp patchxml.sh /usr/local/bin/patchxml
 
Finally...
----------

Please note that this is an unstable alpha release.
diffxml and patchxml are released under the GNU GPL Version 2.
 
Send any bug reports / problems to amouat@postmaster.co.uk

Good Luck.
