Test Suite for diffxml and patchxml
===================================

XML files in "working" directory are correctly handled (though perhaps 
not optimally).
XML files in "wrong" directory are incorrectly handled.
XML files in "crash" directory cause the programs to crash.

The ant build file runs through the files in the working directory, 
checking they are handled properly.
To use, simply run the "ant" command in this directory.
